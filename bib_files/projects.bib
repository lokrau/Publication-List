  annotation = {We investigated a simple example problem to demonstrate how a university final project might be described in academic writing. Using synthetic data and placeholder models, we ran a small experimental pipeline to produce illustrative results. My main contributions were implementing the example experiments, organizing the results section, and writing the majority of the project report.}

  year       = {2025},
  annotation = {This project explored the behavior of dummy models on synthetic datasets to provide a concrete example of experimental design, evaluation, and reporting for a course assignment. We compared several placeholder approaches using basic metrics to highlight common patterns in student projects. I was responsible for designing the evaluation setup, running the experiments, and summarizing the findings in clear, example-focused language.}
