  annotation = {My bachelor’s thesis evaluated a fictional metric on a small, synthetic image classification task to illustrate how evaluation methods can be transferred between domains. Using a toy convolutional model and example datasets, the work examined basic consistency and interpretability properties of the metric in a controlled, educational setting.}

  annotation = {My master’s thesis developed a sample proof-of-concept system using a fictional smart device to demonstrate how multimodal sensing and adaptive logic can support users during everyday activities. By combining placeholder perception modules with rule-based assistance, the work illustrated core design principles for portable, context-aware support systems. \textbf{It received an example award for demonstration purposes.}}
