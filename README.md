# Publication List
## Author: Lorenz Krause

### Description
This repository provides a LaTeX template for creating a clear and well-structured publication list. The design allows for easy differentiation between various types of scientific contributions, such as publications, theses, projects, and more, while maintaining a clean and professional layout. Each entry also includes a short description, enabling concise explanations of individual contributions. In addition, the template includes code for attaching a consistently styled list of references, making it suitable for academic CVs and personal publication overviews.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Update the files in the `bib_files` folder with your own publication data in BibTeX format. You can add and delete new `.bib`files, but you need to update the `main.tex`for them to be displayed correctly. Add your short description of each scientific contribution as shown in the examples.
3. Compile the `main.tex` file using a LaTeX editor or command line tool that supports BibTeX.
4. Customize the styling and layout as needed by modifying the LaTeX code in `main.tex`.
